This test automation is a sample of UiPath's ability to implement the behavior described in the prompt below:

Task:

- Develop a UiPath automation that would:
- Loop through each file in a specific folder (say c:\stamping or other on your computer)
- Open each PDF file (Its ok to open using Adobe Reader software which is freely available)
- Click on File > Print
- Choose Orientation as Landscape if current orientation is Portrait
- Choose printer as Adobe PDF
- Save the resultant Landscape version as a PDF with a suffix (Example if original file is Welcome.pdf, final file name should be welcome-landscape.pdf) in a folder of your choice (like C:\landscapepdfs)
